    <p>I continued to learn more through Wikiversity and reviewed Social Media. The one activity that I reviewed was GCFLearnFree: Instagram under social media. There are so many social media applications out there but one of the more popular ones is Instagram. I use Instagram daily as it is a great way to see what learn about what others are doing or exploring. You must be 13 years old to create an Instagram account.  Instagram allows you to post a photo or video to your account. A post on Instagram is a photo or video that you are sharing with your friends. One of the most popular features is the filters you can add to give the photo a unique and artistic look.  A feed is when someone else or your posts of a photo shows on the home screen. You can add captions or comments to posts. You will see a profile and you can click it to see people’s stories through photos or videos. You can view the stories for 24 hours before it gets wiped away. There is also a search to find things that you may be interested in. The image with the plus sign is for you to take a photo or video to share in your photo library and post. If you like something there is a heart icon that you can click on which lets others know that you like what they posted. The person icon is the profile where you can see all your posts or update your photo. The airplane icon is the direct message where you and the other person can speak privately. You can also tag people in your post.  If you want to add a location you can do that by adding location by searching up the place. If you want to delete a photo, click on the three dots in the upper right-hand corner and choose delete. You can also follow people by searching up their user or in your suggestions for you.  Most importantly, you can make your account private or public it is your decision. This way you can determine who can see you your post. I keep my Instagram private because I don’t want all my information public and don’t want people that I don’t know looking at my account. I use Instagram to share my photos with my friends so I can keep up with their lives and they can keep up with my life. It also allows me to express myself as well.  Social media is an important part of life and can be used for professional reasons with apps like LinkedIn in job searches and building networks.  I plan on using that for my professional growth. </p>
