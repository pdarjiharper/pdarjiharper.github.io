    <p>As I was reading through this assignment, I thought this was going to be fun as I was finally going to learn how to add some images. The first this I did was create an image using Firefly Adobe AI. I had not used AI before so it was interesting to see how fast an image was created with a description. I put in an image of butterflies on a tropical island and the image was generated in less than a minute. This can be really useful for websites as images make them more presentable. After generating the images, I learned how to add those images to my webpage by using HTML. After adding the “img” HTML element referencing the image on my webpage the image showed up after some trouble shooting.  I had put my image in the image folder so I had to get my source path right so I learned how trouble shoot.  I also learned how to put a height and width so I was able to adjust the size which can be useful in designing a website. I then focused on adding a YouTube video to my web page using an iFrame. I had found a video of Hawaii and used the link in the web browser but that did not work when I put that in the iFrame source. I then went to the shared link on YouTube which had an embedded link. When I used the embedded link provided it worked. I then put the same style sheet as I did with the other Web Pages.   This assignment help learns more about HTML elements, using images and videos.</p>
