    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p style="color:blue;margin-left:30px;">This weekâ€™s assignment was a really fun one as I was able to learn about CSS. From this CSS experience, I learned how to create external style sheets. Style Sheets allow you to create a presentation layer that can pretty up your website. By adding a style sheet to my html pages, I was able to make changes to my background color, font, font color, font size, margins, and more. The best part was once I referenced the style sheet from all my html page I was able to change the style in one spot. I also learned about Internal style sheet where you can update one page so it does not affect the other pages. You can apply the style to the page you want to update. In addition, I added an inline style sheet is where you can style a single element. This assignment showed me how I could design potential website in the future. I learned how I could make a website look more appealing and presentable.</p>
