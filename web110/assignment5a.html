<p>For this weekâ€™s assignment I learned more about HTML and its elements. As I was learning about html I was also learning about unordered lists as we were asked to create one. Along with that my list needed to be linkable to my other pages that I had previously created so I learned about HREFs. As I was doing this, I was visually thinking of how I would do it in Microsoft Word as a bulleted list.  I can use unordered list on websites to make the content organized just like bullets. HREFs allow me to link to all my pages any other websites I want easily get to. HREFs are used on all website if you want to link to something which is what I would do for any websites that I would create. </p>
