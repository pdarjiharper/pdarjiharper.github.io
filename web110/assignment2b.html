    <p> As part of the Internet fundamentals review, I continued to learn more through Wikiversity and reviewed two more topics.  The first activity that I reviewed was TutorialsPoint: Search Engines.  I always wondered how the internet works and how we are able to find the websites that we are looking for.  Well, this activity talks about how a Search Engine such as Google crawls a huge Database like the Web to find the information that we are looking for.  Google has a user interface where a user can put in its search criteria.   The search engine looks for keywords in the database that are associated to a website.  What I realized is how important the content is on a website so that Google can find the Information that is relevant.   It’s important that ranking of the website is high on the search.   If the website is ranked low then it may not show up until page ten of a search where people will not go to.  In order for websites to be ranked its pages need to be indexed so search engines can search.   As I want to be in graphic design and work on websites I see how important it is to make sure that websites are built so that search engines can crawl it.  I also learned that when I am doing my searches I should be refining it so I can find information with different keywords.</p>
<p> The second activity that I reviewed was IBM Technology: AI vs. Machine Language under Search Engines. AI is trying to match the capabilities to a human.  In order to do this some of the things involved are the ability to discover and infer based on the information read. Machine Learning involves predictions or decisions based on data that is provided. As more data is provided the predictions become more accurate and decisions are based upon that data. Machine Learning is the ability to learn as more data is provided. There are a couple different types of Machine learning with one of them being supervised Machine Learning and the second one being Unsupervised Machine Learning. One has more humans involved seeing the machine and looking at the data being provided. Unsupervised is able to run more on its owns and finding things that were not explicitly stated.   In the end, Machine Learning is a subset of AI. AI involves deep learning and multiple layers including language processing, vision, Text to Speech, and motion.   I didn’t realize it but AI is around everything in our lives today.   I use Text to Speech almost every single day as I have a learning disability and I didn’t think that it involved AI. Text to Speech helps me learn better with the text being read to out loud. I use social media and you can see that it is constantly learning with the recommendations it provides.   Last but not least, I use streaming services such as Netflix and it gives recommendations of what to watch based on my viewing habits.   AI is here to stay and is being used on every aspect of our lives. </p>
