    <h1>Web Accessiblity</h1>
    <p>For this week’s assignment, I learned about Web Accessibility which is extremely important.  I learned that there are all sorts of tools for people with different disabilities. As technology has developed and more things are being done online, we need to make sure that it is accessible to people with different needs. For people with visual impermeant, they use screen magnifiers or physical magnifiers. It is important to follow W3 standards and make sure fonts are large enough. Screen readers should be able to read the text out loud. People who have a hearing impermeant use captions or even transcripts. I also learned I need to take into account the colors I choose as it may impact those that are color blind. I really didn’t think about this at first but this is something that I need to be aware of for any website I work as it has to be accessible. These were just some of the accessibility points as there are more.  I have a learning disability and it was good to see how accessibility can be applied to my website and the tools used to test it.</p>
