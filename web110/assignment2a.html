    <p>As part of the Internet fundamentals review, I continued to learn more through Wikiversity and reviewed two more topics.  The first activity that I reviewed was GCFLearnFree: Chrome Web Browsers. Chrome is one the easiest web browser to use and one that I use personally. Chrome is constantly getting updated and makes sure that it keeps up with latest feature and securities.  One important feature Chrome has is that it will let you know if you are visiting a hazardous website.   In addition, it has certain icons to let you know if a website is secure or not.   This lesson brought to light those icons in the address bar and what I should be looking out for. Chrome also allows you to customize your theme so you can customize to your liking.  There is also the ability to add extensions by going to the web store and adding blockers if you don’t like all those ads.  Something new I learned was the ability to translate the website to another language if you needed.   I didn’t realize that as that allows me to use other website and covert them to English. I learned how to view two objects at once in chrome. All you have to do is move the tab to a separate window by clicking the tab and dragging it down.  One thing that I will start to use more of are the short-cuts which I wasn’t using before.   I will start the short-cut for new window such as “Ctrl +N” and the short-cut for New Tab which is “Ctrl +T”.   I also learned that there are more options when you click on more tools under the three dots by the profile. If you want to save a page you can either click the start or click “Ctrl +D”. To organize your bookmarks, you can use bookmark manager.  One that that I learned was some of the plugins frequently contain known vulnerabilities so you have to be very careful regarding what you add. </p>
<p>The second activity that I reviewed was GCFLearnFree: Safari. I was thinking that I would learn more about the differences. However, I would have to say that that Safari and Chrome are similar in many ways. Safari is only for Apple users while Chrome can be used on Windows, Android and iOS device.  They both have a back and front button along with refresh button They both have the bookmark option but slightly different as to how you add them. Safari can display different types of documents, media, and other files similar to chrome. Safari has extensions like chrome but it does not have as many as chrome. The extensions are not created by or approved by Safari as they are created by third-party providers.  Safari allows you to do some customization but I am able to do much more through Chrome. In Safari, privacy settings is under preferences. You can delete your history by click showing all history then clicking clear history. In Safari there is a time frame you can erase. In Safari there is a private window and will become dark so you know it is private window.  I think the biggest thing Safari has is its privacy monitoring.   Safari and Chrome are both great browsers but as a Windows user I would use chrome for when I am on my laptop.   However, I have an iPhone so I also use Safari so these lessens taught me more about what I can do to enhance and secure my experience. </p>
