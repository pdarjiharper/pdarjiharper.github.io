    <p> I continued to learn more through Wikiversity and reviewed two more topics. The first activity that I reviewed was TutorialPoints:  Internet Protocols under Networking. Internet protocols are essentially a set of rules that determine how data packets are directed so they can reach their intended destination across networks.  TCP or Transmission Control Protocol was the first Protocol that was mentioned. TPC offers Stream Data Transfer, Reliability, Efficient Flow Control, Full-duplex operation, and Multiplex.   TCP is considered to be reliable as it sequences the bytes with an acknowledgment number so that the destination knows the next byte.   TCP also offers services at the application layer.  The other Protocol discussed was Internet Protocol which is not considered to be reliable.  It needs to be paired with TCP so that it can become reliable. The Datagram is divided into two sections which are header and data.  User Datagram Protocol (UDP) was another protocol mentioned for small amounts of data.   It is connection-less and not reliable.  File Transfer Protocol of FTP was another protocol mentioned.   This is used to transfer files which I can see myself using when I have to transfer files securely from one server to another.  I imagine that this is one of the ways companies transfer some information between one another.  The other connection being Telnet which allows you to remote into a computer from another.  Finally, the one that I can see having a big impact on me would be Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).   HTTP is used to communicate from the browser and the webserver.   As I want to go into graphic design and work on websites I would be using this type of protocol.   An HTTP Request has a Request line, Header Fields, and Message body.    If you look at any of the website URLs, they all have HTTP.   As I need to have reliable connections to work with applications, I feel that I would have to work with TCP and Telnet as well.  </p> 
<p>The second activity that I reviewed was TutorialPoints: Internet Domain Name System.   This was one of the most interesting activities as I was able to learn more about how the domains get routed to servers.   Domain Name System also known as DNS translates the domain name to an IP Address.    The IP address is the internet address of the host server. An example of this could be https://www.youtube.com/.    The DNS will have the serverâ€™s name of the URL and map it to the IP address so it knows where to go when you type the URL in the browser.   The page that gets loaded on your browser is the file name. As noted in the previous activity HTTP would be the protocol for this situation.   The term COM in the URL is probably the most known top level generic domain.  However, there are many others depending on what it is being used for.  COM is used for commercial while EDU is used for EDU and GOV being used for government.   There is also a domain name space which is used for hierarchy to have sub-domains.   As I want to work on websites, I would be using Domain and updating DNS so that I can present my web pages on the internet.   I would need to get further educated on this to explore so I can learn how to structure my web pages and its hierarchy. </p>
