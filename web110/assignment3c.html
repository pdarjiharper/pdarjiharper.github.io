    <p> I continued to learn more through Wikiversity and reviewed Communications. The one activity that completed was TutorialPoint: Internet Services under communication. There are four categories under Internet services which are communication services, information retrieval services, web services, and World Wide Web.  A majority of us have internet and we use an Internet Service Provider such as AT&T. Internet Service Provider, also known as ISP can be classified into six categories which are access providers, mailbox providers, hosting IPs, virtual IPs, and free IPs. When focusing on the access I learned about all the different types of connections out there. There are six different connection types which are Dial-up connection, ISDN, DSL, Cable TV Internet Connection, Wireless Internet Connect and, Satellite Internet Connection. One of the older connection types is Dial-up. I remember how my Dad says how lucky we are because he had to use dial-up when he was younger and said that it was slow. Dial-up is method that connects the PC to Internet while using the telephone line. DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line which is a broadband connection. Another method is the Cable TV method works as a coaxial cable.  This is what I have in my house and transfers data at a much higher speed than the telephone line. I would also like to note that cable modem allows for two signals which can be used for TV or internet. Another popular method is satellite internet connection.This a popular method for people that are in remote areas.  Finally, my favorite connection has to be Wireless internet connection.  I say that is my favorite because I use that type of connection for all my devices.  Connectivity is huge because when itâ€™s not there everything comes to a stop as it is a big part of our everyday life. </p>
