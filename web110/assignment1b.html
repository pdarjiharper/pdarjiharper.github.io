    <h1>Internet Basics</h1>
    <p> As part of the Internet fundamentals review, I went to Wikiversity reviewed two topics.  The first activity that I reviewed was GCFLearnFree Internet Basics. I learned about the basics of how the internet works and how everything is connected. As Iâ€™m interested in graphic design I was able to see how information is sent and received over the network. The internet is used in almost every aspect of our life.  We used to primarily get our information through television and print newspaper.   Now all of that information is coming through the internet. The knowledge of how this works will help me with my everyday career work as well as my education.  On a daily basis I communicate by email and get news from digital newspapers.  Books are Newspapers started to become blogs instead of paper. When I am free I will watch my favorite shows through online streaming services such a Netflix or Disney Plus. That all uses the internet so I learned how that information is coming from a server over the internet. I use web browsers on a daily basis to search up topics and get any information that I may need. </p><p> The second activity that I reviewed was TutorialsPoint Internet Technologies.   That also went through the fundamentals as to how the DNS is an address of where we can get to the websites we are searching for.  It talked about the evolution of the internet and advantage of it.  Social Networking being one of those advantages of getting information out quickly.  This is one aspect of where my life was impacted by the internet and that is by social media platforms as that is how I communicate.  The internet has many network services and some of the most well-known is social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. I use social media platform every single day. Even for me I like to take pictures and post them to my Instagram.  Each image is a file which gets uploaded to the cloud.  Many people even use the social media platform to promote their companies.  There are so many aspects of where I can use this professionally for when I want to promote myself when searching for a job on networking sites.   The other aspects that were covered were some of the disadvantages.   I learned that I have to be careful with my personal information as there are cyber criminals out there wanting to take advantage and get my information.  In additional, I need to be aware of virus attacks and spams.</p>
