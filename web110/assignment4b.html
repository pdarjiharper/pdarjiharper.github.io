<p>For this week’s assignment, I continued to learn more through Wikiversity and reviewed two more topics. The first activity that I reviewed was GCFLearnFree: Internet Safety under Security.  The Internet is one of the greatest resources created and used on a daily basis by everyone. However, using the internet does not come without some risk. That doesn’t mean we should be afraid but need to use it safely.  The tutorial went through creating strong passwords. A password should not have any personal information as hacker’s user computers to guess their password. Passwords should not be easy to guess or be shared. You should use a strong, long, and difficult password so no one can get your information. The tutorial also went through browser security features. A user should look for the security symbol next to the URL so that they know they are accessing a secure website. It mentioned that you should check the domain name to make sure you are going to a trusted site. Cybercriminals are trying to get you to go to these untrusted websites so that they can trick you to give up your personal information. Keeping your OS and browser updated is important to protecting your computer as they have the latest patches. When shopping online you should look for the lock symbol to make sure it is a secure website to shop from. Make sure the business has a physical address and phone number so that you can contact them. It also mentioned not to direct wire transfer and use credit cards are the safest way to pay online. You can also use PayPal or Google Wallet if you don’t want to give your credit card information. These are all important things to know for me as a user so that I protect myself.  In addition, understanding these safety measures are things I would need to apply when working on websites. Users should feel safe on websites that I would work on. </p>
<p>The second activity that I reviewed was TutorialPoint: Internet Security.  In this activity, I learned about security communication. There are Internet Security Protocols that provide network security and create authentication.  Secure Socket Layer provides security for privacy, integrity, and authentication. Some of the internet security threats are Mobile Worms, Malware, Ransomware, Large scale attacks on infrastructure, Hacking, Spam, and Phishing. The main purpose of email phishing is to steal sensitive information. Emails are sent to users which look real from companies that you might have heard of. However, these emails are fake as cybercriminals want you to click on them in order to steal your information. The basic rule is to not click on suspicious links in emails. The next part the activity went into was data encryption. There two types of encryptions mentioned are symmetric key encryption and public key encryption. Symmetric Key Encryption uses the same cryptographic for encryption and decryption of cipher text. Public Key Encryption uses a pair of keys. There is a secret key and the other one being a public key that are linked together. Digital signatures were the next thing reviewed which is used to authenticate the source of the message that was sent. Finally, the activity went into firewalls which is used to protect you and the data. A firewall will filter network traffic. Security would be used by me for my personal and professional career. It is important my data is secure in anything that we do as the impacts can be really impactful.</p>
