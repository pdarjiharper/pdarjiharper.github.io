    <h2>Final Project Idea</h2>
    <p>As I was brainstorming for my final project, I was deciding on what has had the most influence in many of our lives today. Many of these topics discussed in class are important but I chose the one that I use the most and that would be social media. I wanted to then start organizing my thoughts and started thinking of how I would structure my presentation.  I thought of breaking it down into sections by starting with the history/origin, purpose of it, benefits/disadvantages, popular social media platforms, privacy, and security. History and origins will go into how social media came to be. The purpose of social media is going to talk about why social media has become so important along benefits and disadvantages. I will cover the popular social media apps and what they are used for. Finally, I will go into Privacy and Security which will be important to keep your information private I am going to show you how you can make your information private. </p> 
  <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p> This activity helped me get a visual representation of what I have to complete for the final project. This also helped me organize my thoughts and tasks. Once I had that I was able to put a timeline in place so know when I need to get that specific task done and meet the assignment date.  I like to work ahead to get my projects done so I always have a checklist in the back of my mind. But now I have a visual checklist to make sure I do not forget anything. In terms of future environments, having a project plan in place can help organize a team and put everyone on the same page. I would use this to help myself and my team organized.</p>
