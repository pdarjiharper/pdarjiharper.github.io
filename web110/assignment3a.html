    <p> As part of the Internet fundamentals review for this week, I continued to learn more through Wikiversity and reviewed two additional topics. The first activity that I reviewed was GCF Global: Email Basics under Email. Email is to send and receive messages across the internet. As mentioned in the activity, it is a similar concept as regular mail but at an almost instantaneous speed across the world.  You need to have the correct email address from that specific person.  The first portion of the email address is the username which is before the “@” symbol.  After the “@” symbol is the domain of the email provider. The popular email providers are Yahoo, Gmail, and Outlook. An online address book is where you can store contact information for people you frequently contact. You can link your email to your Facebook or LinkedIn.  Email service providers have tools that allow you to file, label, prioritize, find, group, and filter your emails for easy management.  I personally use Yahoo and Gmail because they are the easiest to work with. I have used Gmail while in school and Yahoo for my personal email. Yahoo and Gmail are similar in many ways as they both have message features, junk, trash, and much more. Yahoo doesn’t have a drive but Gmail does. Drive is where you can store images, files, and etc. Gmail also has calendar features. The calendar feature is where you can add important dates such as appointments, due dates, plans which is what I use to keep track of my tasks and assignments. You can also share the calendar with your family and friends. You can access both on the computer or through the phone.  Emails are a necessity of life now as that is how much of our communication and documents are sent these days.  Almost anything I have signed up for requires or asks for an email address.   Professional jobs provide email addresses as well as that is how they communicate with one another.  I see myself having to do the same when I go into my professional career.</p>
<p> The second activity that I reviewed was TutorialsPoint: E-mail Overview. Within this overview I leaned about the different components involved in email.   At the beginning of an email there is a header that has From, Date, To, Subject, CC, and BCC. CC stands for carbon copy and is intended for those that we just want to raise awareness but not the one the email was intended for. BCC stands for Black Carbon Copy which is used when you don’t’ want recipients to know that someone else was copied on the message.  I had always learned it as a blind copy but they are both the same. Emails are cheap, fast, and can be used worldwide. However, there can be some disadvantages of email as you can get overwhelmed with junk email.  I get so many of those that I try to block them as it makes it hard to get to the important emails. In addition, there are many spam emails where some are trying to get your personal information by sending bad links for you to click so they can infect your computer. The one thing new that I learned about was e-mail protocols. Some of the e-mail protocols are SMTP, POP, and IMAP. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. IMAP stands for Internet Message Access Protocol. These protocols were created to establish a standard for exchanging emails between servers on the internet. It also discussed IMAP which allows programs to manipulate the e-mail message like deleting a message on the server before downloading them to your computer. POP stands for Post Office Protocol which is more for single mail boxes while IMAP is for multiple boxes. POP does not have functionality which is something that I use all the time. It would be so difficult to find anything if I was not able to search. This lesson was more technical but my usage of emails would be the same as I how mentioned in my other activity.   However, I have used features like CC and BCC when I wanted to keep others involved. </p>
