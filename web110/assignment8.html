	<p>The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.</p>	
    	<ul style="list-style-type:none">
        	<li>UPDATE table_name</li>

    <p> <b>Summary</b> <br>For this assignment, I learned about database queries which was interesting. In the last assignment, I had to go into each of the individual tables and manually find the information for each question. I saw with the SQL queries I can get the information needed with the SELECT statements. I learned some basic queries which can be helpful and save much time in the future will looking through data. The SELECT statement where I had to modify Where Country= USA was really helpful as it showed how to get to the data. I had to use multiple unordered lists for each of the specific questions. The video was helpful to understand what was being requested. The video helped in terms of where I had to put Select * From Customers. I then realized the ‘p’ tag was being used as the description. This all had to fit inside the UL tags. I also understood where value came into play which is what fields it is going to or coming from.  I was able to try modifying the queries and see them working based off of the information I was looking for. Having an organized table with different fields makes it easier to find what you are looking for.</p>
