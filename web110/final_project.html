    <p>During this semester I had the opportunity to learn more about the fundamentals of the Internet. I use the internet all the time but it was nice to learn more about the specifics of what is involved in the internet. I already knew some things about social media, search engines, web browsers, and email but not as much as I thought. I learned more about security and privacy as there are always those trying to get to your information. I need to be more aware of my security for email, web browser, social media, and my connections. I enjoyed learning more about Networking as I didn’t know much about that specific topic. I hadn’t used much HTML before this class so it was really fun to start building out my own website.  When I was able to add images and videos to the website it was really fun to see. Web Accessibility is a big one I use it on a day-to-day basis for myself so it was great to see how it works behind the scenes. Project management was also really important for me as I learned how to plan out my tasks or activities.  In all, this was a great class that I really enjoyed.</p>
