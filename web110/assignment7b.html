    <p> <b>Summary</b> <br>For this assignment I learned about how data can be organized. It was interesting to see how many tables were created to structure the data. I learned that 	if you have proper structure such as customer, order, order detail, products, suppliers, categories, employees, and shippers you can get to the information 	you need. Inside each table it gives you the respective data for the fields inside that specific category. It took me a few minutes but I realized that the 	table would be linked by the keys in each of the tables. I just had searched in the specific table that the question was related to. I found out while 		doing this activity that two tables link together where OrderID was in the Order Table as well as the OrderDetail table. As I understood that, I was then 	able to then link all the other tables by following the keys.   I think this assignment can be apply to the future as it helps to put structure for any 	database tables that I would need for my websites. I will organize my tables into specific category so it easier to look up.</p>
